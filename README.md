# ScrabbleApps
This project contains a Scrabble game built with an adobe flex front end and a java backend as well as 3 training apps.  The original project used java and flex php and mysql and was build a decade ago. Since then two javascript apps have been added.  angular.htm runs with angular and reads from php, the node version reads directly from mysql. the code has been refactored and Docker files have been added.
